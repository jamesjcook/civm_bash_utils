civm_bash_utils library for civmscripts and common utility function scripts
This is a library for shell scripts.
Most functions are included in the functions file.
Some auxilary utility is contained in the other scripts dealing with OSX launchd.
Specifically these other scripts make up james's framework for checking up on 
and controlling launchdscripts, including default installers and others.
Most of these scripts assume you're in the directory you want them to operate on.
