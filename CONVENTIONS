===Default utility scripts===
These utility scripts are generalized so that any script made this way will work.
So install and restart both rely on the following assumptions
there is only one file of the form <br/>
<.*>.plist  - launchd automation to be placed in /Library/LaunchDaemons
there is only one file of the form <br/>
civm* this is the main script and a link will be created to its parent directory in /Users/Shared/scriptname  
<SCRIPTNAMEDIR>.sh  - main script

Some files should just be links back to the civmlibrary in james's home directory such as functionscivmscript.sh
other scripts in this directory should start with something differnt 

distributionlist.sh                          file containing the hostname -s_user entries for each computer a given program/script is deployed on.

To use these you should be in the civmscript directory, not the lib directory, and run with lib/scriptname
<br/>lib should just be a link to ../civmlibrary, it could actually be in lib, but then you'd have a copy for each civmscript.

| *Scriptname*                                | *function* |
| startlaunchdscripts.sh                      | run program with parameters from scheduler |
| checkstatus.sh                              | check contents of scheduler and contents in system and check that its loaded, can tell if its running currently |
| restartscheduler.sh                         | restart scheduler (stopscheduler, and start scheduler) doesnt run program |
| uninstallscheduler.sh                       | uninstall scheduler (stopscheduler, and remove) |
| stopscheduler.sh                            | stop scheduler   (stop program and unload scheduler) |
| startcheduler.sh                            | start scheduler  (load scheduler) |
| installscheduler.sh                         | install scheduler  (stopscheduler, and copy, and startscheduler) | 
| generateallwiki.bash | generates all twiki page text from the info files in current dir best run only by james on his workspace folder |
| reinstallscheduler.sh | re-installs schduler, (uninstallscheduler, installscheduler) |
| checktrunkvstags.bash | tagging script, to tag in svn the current version, controlled through version file, warns for uncommited changes |
| svncheckallreleases.bash | runs checktrunkvstags.bash on all folders in a folder. |
| svncomitall.sh | commits all directories in curent directory, with generic "name update message |
| utilitycivmshellscriptskeleton.sh |  |  
| makerelease.bash | makes sure current version is commited to svn, tagged in svn, and then bundles it up in a tarbal to somelocation, i think /Users/Shared/civmscripreleases |
| deployrelease.sh | experimental script, not finished, plan is to copy script to anythign in distributionlist |  
| fetchremoteconfigs.sh			      | check if remote configurations are modified, looks at distributionlist.sh to find hosts | 
| remoteversions.sh			      | checks remote versions against current version, looks at distributionlist.sh to find hosts | 
| installcivmlaunchdscript.txt                | install program to the default location and install the scheduler | 
| installcivmlaunchdscript_blind.txt          | install program to the default location and install the scheduler | 
| installcivmlaunchdscriptperhostperuser.txt  | install program to the default location and install the scheduler | 
| functionscivmlaunchdscript.bash             | functions for launchdscripts, dealing with configs among other things, a global functions file, so i'm more likley to reuse well coded functions |
