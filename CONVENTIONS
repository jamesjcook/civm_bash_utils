The utility scripts are generalized so that any script made this way will work. 
So install and restart both rely on the following assumptions
there is only one file of the form 
<.*>.plist  - launchd automation to be placed in /Library/LaunchDaemons
there is only one file of the form 
civm* this is the main script and a link will be created to its parent directory in /Users/Shared/scriptname  
<SCRIPTNAMEDIR>.sh  - main script

Some files should just be links back to the civmlibrary in james's home directory such as functionscivmscript.sh
other scripts in this directory should start with something differnt 

distributionlist.sh                          file containing the hostname -s_user entries for each computer a given program/script is deployed on.
===Default utility scripts===
startlaunchdscripts.sh                       run program
checkstatus.sh                               check contents of scheduler and contents in system and check that its loadded
restartscheduler.sh                          restart scheduler (stopscheduler, and start scheduler)
uninstallscheduler.sh                        uninstall scheduler (stopscheduler, and remove)
stopscheduler.sh                             stop scheduler   (stop program and unload scheduler)
startcheduler.sh                             start scheduler  (load scheduler)
installscheduler.sh                          install scheduler  (stopscheduler, and copy, and startscheduler)
installcivmlaunchdscript.txt                 install program to the default location and install the scheduler 
installcivmlaunchdscript_blind.txt           install program to the default location and install the scheduler
installcivmlaunchdscriptperhostperuser.txt   install program to the default location and install the scheduler
functionscivmlaunchdscript.bash              functions for launchdscripts, dealing with configs among other things, a global functions file, so i'm more likley to reuse well coded functions
